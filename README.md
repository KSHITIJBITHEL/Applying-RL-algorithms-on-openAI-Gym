<p> This Repository contains the code for implementing various Reinforcement Learning Algorithms on the Standard OpenAI Gym Environments</p>
<p> I started with implementing tabular q learning on mountain car and cartpole environments and shown here below is the result of the same </p>

 <b> RETURN V/s EPISODES (500 being the max one can get)</b>
</br>  Then I implemented DDPG Algorithm on the Mountain Car Continuous environment ,which was able to solve it in ~120 Iterations. Here are the results

<b> RETURN(Red),AVERAGE RETURN(Green) V/s EPISODES </b>
Criteria for Solving the Environment : Get score above 90
